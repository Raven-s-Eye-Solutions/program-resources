# Class project requirements

These are the requirements for the project you will manage during the class.

- Each project will serve a single page application (SPA) from the backend.

- The backend will also be a REST API server for your frontend.

- The backend will have have at least 1 asynchronous process / routine as well. This can be functionality that does some kind of data processing, calls an external API, manipulates or analyzes information, etc.

- The SPA will have some kind of router
  - [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
  - [React router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
  - [React mini router](https://github.com/larrymyers/react-mini-router)
  - [Universal router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal-router)
  - [Router5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/router5)

- The SPA will have at least 3 pages

- The SPA will make at least 5 API calls to the REST server

- The SPA will make use of a state management library or pattern:
  - [flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
  - [Recoil (for those who want to be on the cutting edge)](https://recoiljs.org/)
  - [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
  - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
  - [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
  - [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
  - [Pullstate](https://lostpebble.github.io/pullstate/)
  - [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated)

- The App will make use of a CSS framework or library
  - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Picnic](https://picnicss.com/)
  - [Mustard UI](https://kylelogue.github.io/mustard-ui/index.html)
  - [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/)
  - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

  - [Milligram](https://milligram.io/)
  - And there are tons more....

In this class we won't focus on Databases since that is really a separate topic from the concepts of becoming a good project designer, programmer, and problem solver. (In MOST development jobs you will never write database queries, but instead interact with an abstraction layer such as an ORM or ODM) For this reason it is ok to use an "in memory" database for this project, aka a variable object on the backend to persist data throughout sessions. That being said, if you want to hook up a database, go for it.
